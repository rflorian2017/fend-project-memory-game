## Instructions

For playing the game, you have to load index.html in your favourite browser.
When the page is loaded, a timer starts , indicating the time spent playing the game.

In order to play, you have to click one of the cards in the deck which is faced down. If you click one card, it will show you the face. 
If you click another one, there are two situations: 
a) If the cards match, an animation will turn them light green
b) If they do not match, an effcet will make you know they do not match. They will have a red background and will be turned face down again.

The moves will increase by one at any two opened cards.

If your moves are less than 12 you will win with 3 stars.

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).
