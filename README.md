## Instructions

For playing the game, you have to load index.html in your favourite browser.
Each time the game is refreshed or restarted, the cards are shuffled randomly.
When the page is loaded, a timer starts , indicating the time spent playing the game.

In order to play, you have to click one of the cards in the deck which is faced down. If you click one card, it will show you the face. 
If you click another one, there are two situations: 
a) If the cards match, an animation will turn them light green
b) If they do not match, an effect will make you know they do not match. They will have a red background and will be turned face down again.

The moves will increase by one at any two opened cards.

If your moves are less than 12 you will win with 3 stars. Otherwise, you will still win, but you will have only one star.

When all cards match, a winning message will appear , showing how many stars you got, how many moves you used and the total time spent in the game.
To restart, you can refresh the page, you can click on the refresh button under the title. Or , you can win and click the "Play again" button to re-start the game.

The timer and the score are reset in case of re-play, re-start or refresh.

Have fun !
